## Belonging and inclusion
Βelonging:  $$
a\in A
$$

A is a *subset* of B, or B includes A:$$ 
A \subset B
$$

Two sets are equal if and only if they have the *same elements*.

## Set specification
D: the set of all dogs
d: dog
*The set of all black dogs*: 
$$
B= \left\{d\in D: d is black \right\}
$$
οr
$$
B= \left\{d\in D|\, d is black \right\}
$$
Τhe colon （:） or vertical bar （|）read as "such that".
